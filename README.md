This program predicts rented bike count by choosing appropriate independent variables
It also identifies: 
- the factors that influence the number of bikes rented
- explores the data for outliers and missing values, and removes them
- plots the correlation between all variables and identify the important features
- encodes categorical variables 
- performs linear regression model to predict rented bike count by choosing appropriate independent variables
